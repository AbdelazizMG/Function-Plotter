# Master-Micro-Softrware-Intern-Task-01
This is an application developed using the App designer tool in MATLAB R2021a for Master Micro Software Internship 2022.

# Description

- The GUI developed to be simple and user-friendly to be used to plot different functions ( Linear - Quadratic - Trigonometric ).
- The GUI is divided into to main Sections, The input section and output section:
   - The Input Section consists of three text boxes to handle the required function , xmin and xmax.
   - The Output Section consists only of the UI Axis to handle the function plotting.
   - Between the two sections there is a button which contains the application functionality.
